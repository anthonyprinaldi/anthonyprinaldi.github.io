I recently completed my Master's degree in computer science (MScAC) from the University of Toronto. I am currently working as a Research Software Developer at Sunnybrook Research Institute in the Artificial Intelligence and Computational Neuroscience (AICONS) lab.
# Research Interests
---
My interests focus on general intelligence and creating systems that can think and reason in a similar capacity to humans. I am of the belief that current AI systems do not exhibit intent or meaning in their outputs, which must change to achieve *true intelligence*. I enjoy exploring the topics of cognitive science, neuroscience, and psychology. I am also interested in the intersection of machine learning and neuroscience.
