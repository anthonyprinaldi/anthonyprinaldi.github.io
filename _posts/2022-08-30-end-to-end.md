During my undergraduate degree, one of my classmates and I took a paper published by Meta Research ([Lewis et al.](https://research.facebook.com/publications/deal-or-no-deal-end-to-end-learning-for-negotiation-dialogues/){:target="\_blank"}) and improved it in a few ways. First, we implemented Transformer architectures rather than using the GRUs originally proposed. We also implemented Monte Carlo Tree Search as opposed to the original simple Rollout method proposed.
