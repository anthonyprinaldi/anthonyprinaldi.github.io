This talk presented research that I contributed to, headed by Professor Annie En-Shiun Lee from the University of Toronto. The team working on this research includes individuals from the University of Toronto, University of Moratuwa, University of New York Tirana, and Microsoft.

We gave a presentation on fine-tuning using multilingual sequence-to-sequence pre-trained models for the purpose of low-resource languages.
